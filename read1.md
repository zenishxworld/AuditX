# Subscription Plan Update Feature - Temporary Solution
I've implemented a temporary solution for the subscription plan update feature to address the error relation "public.user_subscriptions" does not exist . This error occurred because the migration file for the user_subscriptions table exists but hasn't been applied to the database yet.

## Changes Made:
1. 1.
   Modified Pricing.tsx :
   
   - Replaced the Supabase database operations with localStorage to store the user's selected plan
   - Simplified the handlePayment function to use localStorage.setItem('userPlanType', planName)
   - Retained the payment simulation and success notification
2. 2.
   Updated planLimits.ts :
   
   - Modified the getUserPlan function to retrieve the plan type from localStorage instead of the database
   - Added validation to ensure only valid plan types ('Pro' or 'Premium') are returned
   - Added console logging to verify the localStorage solution is working
   - Kept the default return value as 'Free' when no plan is stored
3. 3.
   Verified Dashboard.tsx :
   
   - Confirmed it's using the getUserPlan function from planLimits.ts, which now uses localStorage
   - No changes needed as it will automatically use the updated function
## How This Solution Works:
1. 1.
   When a user selects a subscription plan on the Pricing page, the plan type is stored in localStorage
2. 2.
   The Dashboard and other components retrieve the plan type from localStorage using the getUserPlan function
3. 3.
   This temporary solution allows users to select plans and see their benefits without requiring database changes
## Next Steps (for the development team):
1. 1.
   Apply the migration file to create the user_subscriptions table in the Supabase database
2. 2.
   Once the table exists, revert the changes to use the database instead of localStorage
3. 3.
   Consider adding a data migration script to transfer any localStorage plan selections to the database
This temporary solution ensures users can continue using the application while the database issue is being resolved.
